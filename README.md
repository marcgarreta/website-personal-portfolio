# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website — React + Vite + Vercel

This project is the creation of my personal portfolio website:  
👉 **[https://marcgarretabasora.vercel.app](https://marcgarretabasora.vercel.app)**  

Built with **React** and **Vite**, and deployed on **Vercel**, this site serves as both my official personal website and a learning challenge to explore new technologies and improve my skills.
