        After completing my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">bachelor's final project</a>, which focused on detecting anomalies in patient vital signs, I realized the potential of AI in healthcare and its broader societal relevance. This experience motivated me to pursue a Master's in Data Science, specializing in data science, statistics, and machine learning for enterprises.

        In my spare time, you'll often find me swimming, running, or reflecting on my next steps.
